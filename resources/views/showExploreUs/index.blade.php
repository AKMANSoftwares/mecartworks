        <p class="text-center">
            In the summer of 1979, one fine day, an avid traveller was browsing through the streets of Italy, sightseeing
            and looking for souvenirs to take back home. There he came across the art of mosaic in its most glorious
            form. Little pieces of glass tiles, called tesserae, were being individually selected and arranged together
            to form a breathtaking masterpiece.</p>
        <p class="text-center">So how did MEC go from an inspired tourist to the leading international company that is synonymous with premium quality custom made mosaics today. Let us briefly take you through the journey.
