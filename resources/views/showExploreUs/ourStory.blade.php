                    In the summer of 1979, one ne day, an avid traveller was browsing through the streets of Italy,
                    sightseeing
                    and looking for souvenirs to take back home. There he came across the art of mosaic in its most
                    glorious
                    form. Little pieces of glass tiles, called tesserae, were being individually selected and arranged
                    together
                    to form a breathtaking masterpiece.

                <p class="text-center txt-zaidi-alig">
                    Intrigued by this form of art, the tourist, Hasan Mahmood
                    Zaidi, decided to learn more about the art and explore its various possibilities and applications.
                    He knew
                    he discovered a new passion and decided to bring it back home and so, MEC came into being.

                    So how did MEC go from an army-of-one to the leading international company that is synonymous with
                    premium
                    quality custom made mosaics today. Let us brie y take you through the journey.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center txt-quality-align"> Initially Mr. Zaidi sourced glass mosaic material from the best suppliers around
                    Europe & Asia. Invited Italian Mosaic experts to train our local craftsmen in the centuries old art of hand- made mosaic.
                    He  hand-picked members of his trusty team. Together the team set up a small workshop with the best
                    machinery and tools available and started our operations.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center">
                    Perfecting the existing mosaic techniques, we constantly incorporated the latest in the world of
                    mosaic
                    making and even came up with some of our own procedures.

                <p class="text-center old-story">In late 80’s, we decided to diversify after popular demand of marble mosaic from
                    our existing clientele. MEC
                    imported some premium quality stone from various regions of Europe. Marble Mosaic, being a
                    completely di
                    erent medium proved to be a little challenging for a brief while. Soon enough we acquired enough
                    training
                    and information to introduce a full- edged marble mosaic line to our o erings.
                </p>
                <p class="text-center old-story">In a few short years MEC’s marble mosaic project quality far surpassed most of
                    the marble mosaic companies
                    from around the world. We started transforming intricate rugs into marble mosaic oorings without
                    sacri cing
                    quality or design elements. Be it Roman-inspired and Victorian Designs from the West or the
                    Mediterranean,
                    Persian, Turkish, Arabesque and Moroccan themes from the East; we do it all.
